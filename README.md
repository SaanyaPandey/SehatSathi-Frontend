# SehatSathi-Frontend
This is my first real world project . 
SehatSathi is a community-driven healthcare platform built to bridge the gap between patients and qualified doctors, especially in remote and underprivileged regions.<br>

It offers features like:<br><ul>

<li>Verified doctor & patient registration</li>

<li>Role-based dashboards</li>

<li>Secure login and chat</li>

<li>Basic medical guides like first aid tips</li> </ul><br>

With a clean interface and simplified process, SehatSathi ensures affordable, accessible, and authenticated medical support for all.<br><br><br>
